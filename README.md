# AstroPi-Midi-Music
Creates a midi file from the roll pitch and yaw data collected during the Astro Pi Mission Space Lab


Astro Pi Mission Space Lab offers teams of young people the chance to run scientific experiments
on board the International Space Station. The teams have the opportunity to collect data from various sensors.
One of the sensors collects roll, pitch and yaw data and a second sensor collects magnetometer data in a similar format.
Data from either sensor can be used.

This projects takes this data and converts it to a midi file that can be played in an midi player, for example Audacity.
