# AstroPi-Midi-Music
Creates a midi file from the roll pitch and yaw data collected during the Astro Pi Mission Space Lab
(the magnetometer data can also be used)

Astro Pi Mission Space Lab offers teams of young people the chance to run scientific experiments
on board the International Space Station. The teams have the opportunity to collect data from various sensors.
One of the sensors collects rol, pitch and yaw data.

This projects takes this data and converts it to a midi file that can be played in an midi player, for example Audacity.
