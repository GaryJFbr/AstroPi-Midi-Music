Notes on files and formats

The Astro Pi computers are based on a Raspberry Pi 4 with a camera module and Sense Hat V2 attached.
The roll, pitch and yaw data is collected from the Sense Hat accelerometer, as a python dictionary
in this format  {'roll': 1.0807006359100342, 'pitch': 0.14444319903850555, 'yaw': 1.628937840461731}
For download this value is stored in a single element of a csv file.
When the csv file is opened by the csv module the data is not recognised as a dictionary but as a text string.
The Re (regular expression) module is used to recover the individual values and writes them to the individual lists.

Input file is set in line 33.     ISSfile = open("SampleData2.csv", newline='')
Output file is set in line 87.    open('ISSsoundstrack1.mid', "wb")

The magnetometer returns data in the format {'x': -3.0550496578216553, 'y': 3.3628623485565186, 'z': 1.759469985961914}
so is directly interchangable as the re module doesnt discriminate between the two

Re and MIDIUtil libraries must be installed

NoteNames can be changed to any other octave or any combination of notes, as long as the corresponding variable MaxNote is set to 
(number of notes) - 1. (As the count starts at zero)
OctavesMidiValues is a list of midi values for other octaves.

If MinSound is set to a value below 20 its too quiet to hear the note being played. MaxSound is set to the maximum value of 127.

MinTime and MaxTime is the time the note is played in seconds. 1 and 2 are probably too long, shorter times seem to sound better.
BeatsPerMin,240 is fast, any slower and the music imitates the solemn pace of a funeral procession. 

Roll data is mapped to note, Yaw data is mapped to sound (loudness) and pitch data is mapped to time.
There is no underlying reason to this. Its equally possible to map roll data to sound or time or any other combination.
Potentially giving six midi tracks per input data file.
